# bosun-datasource
Bosun datasource plugin for Grafana

It's still really crude but the basic functions should be working

This is a porting effort based on the code from https://github.com/grafana/grafana-plugins/tree/master/datasources/bosun
I'm creating a separate repository to make it easier to develop and install using grafana-cli

TODO List:
* Fix query interface
* Add support for Alias
* Fix support for Tables
